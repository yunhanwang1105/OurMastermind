        <p>Getting bored? Don't worry, you are more than welcomed to play here!
          We only offer Mastermind so far, more games are in development... But not guarenteed&#128517;

        <div id='rules'><h2>How to play</h2></div>
        <b>Don't worry if you don't fully understand the rules. Once you start a game, we will provide guides that should
            be easily to follow. (starter friendly)</b>

        <p>The game is played using:
          <ol>
            <li>Wait for the code setter set the code. (Setter will have 60 secs to set the code.)</li>
            <li>Code guesser now need to take a guess. Make the guess by clicking on a colour. The'undo' button will remove the most 
                recent colour you clicked.</li>
            <li>Code setter now responds to the given guess by putting key pegs. 
                <ul>
                    <li>One black key peg means the guesser has one correct colour in right position.</li>
                    <li>One white key peg means the guesser has one colour correct but no in right position.</li>
                    <li>If nothing is placed on a key peg position, the guesser then has a wrong colour. </li>
                </ul>
                Notice: The orders don't matter, they only reflects how many correct/incorrect/partially correct 
                colours are there! If there is no pegs, means that one colour is not part of the code.
                We've designed a logic, if the setter gives incorrect responses, a notification will rise.
            </li>
            <li>Guesser makes the next guess, based on what feedback (s)he received. Step 2-4 are repeated until the game ends.</li>
            <li>Game End Conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li>Turns > 10.</li>
                    <li>One player takes too long when it's his/her turn.</li>
                    <li>The guesser worked out the code.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h2>FAQS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>How is the average waiting time calculated?</h4>
            <p>The average time taken for players to be assigned to a match, if you waited for 5 minutes or more and still didn't find a
               match, we will decline your request automatically,  you could start looking for a match again, but we reccommand
               you to come back later! From xxam to xxpm, we have the largest number of players.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Are there any groupchats for this website?</h4>
            <p>Will decide if we get 100&nbsp; active players per day, we are not going to do it right now.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>What if the code setter gives incorrect feedbacks?</h4>
            <p>Don't worry, if the setter gives incorrect responses, a warning will rise. If the setter cannot give the correct
                response on time, guesser will win.
